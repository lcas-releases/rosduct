ros-kinetic-rosduct (0.0.4-0xenial) xenial; urgency=high

  * Merge pull request #2 <https://github.com/LCAS/rosduct/issues/2> from MFernandezCarmona/master
    Update package.xml
  * reintroduced pydispatcher
  * remove pydispatch
    the problem is we need pip install pydispatcher, not pydispatch . So for now we remove this dependency until we have a deb package for this python package
  * Caching Service exceptions...
  * Update conversions.py
  * Update package.xml
    These should solve the following errors I had runing rosduct:
    ImportError: No module named ws4py.client.threadedclient
    ImportError: No module named pydispatch
